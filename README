This is an implementation of a container much like std::vector. It
is meant to be used when the size is expected to be reasonably small.
If the small_vector's size is small enough, it will use internal stack
storage. Only if it becomes too large will it fall back on heap allocation.
This does mean that there is additional memory overhead when used as
a large container, but it should be useful nonetheless.
